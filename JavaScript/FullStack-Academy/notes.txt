- Modules % :: divides two numbers and returns the remainder

- cd 03* :: the star(*) allows us to navigate to the folder with the closest specified name.

- splice(startIdx, [Num of elem to remove], [inputVal1, ... inputValN]) :: Splice cuts off a 
piece of an array and is able to replace the elms


- console.log.toString() :: returns the code inside the log method.

- It's good practice to add a method after an object if it's long lines of code to make the object more readable.
