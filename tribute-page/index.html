            <dl>
                <dt>1856</dt>
                <dd>Tesla was born "at the stroke of midnight" with lightning striking during a summer storm. In
                    Smiljan near GospiÄ‡, Lika, (the Military Frontier of Austria-Hungary, now in Croatia)</dd>

                <dt>1875</dt>
                <dd>At the Polytechnic school Tesla began his studies in mechanical and electrical engineering.</dd>

                <dt>1882</dt>
                <dd>In 1882, Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle
                    used in alternators and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field
                    force to generate torque in rotating machines.</dd>

                <dt>1884</dt>
                <dd>On 6 June 1884, Tesla first arrived in the United States, in New York City with little besides a
                    letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, a former employer.</dd>

                <dt>1886</dt>
                <dd>The Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing was a company formed by Nikola Tesla in 1886</dd>

                <dt>1901</dt>
                <dd>Nikola Tesla began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility ca.</dd>

                <dt>1913</dt>
                <dd>Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse power the World's Columbian Exposition</dd>

                <dt>1914</dt>
                <dd>Tesla's patents state that the device was intended for the use of fluids as motive agents, as
                    distinguished from the application of the same for the propulsion or compression of fluids (though
                    the device can be used for those purposes as well).</dd>

                <dt>1943</dt>
                <dd>Tesla died of heart failure alone in room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel, on 7 January 1943.</dd>
